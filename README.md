# Trading Bot Version #1
This Project is where I learned about Python environments, git, data anlysis with python, stock market trading strategies, API plugins and more. This is
the first version where I learned lots about pandas and how it can be used. It creates multiple files for the day that can be checked
and holds data for each specific stock. In future versions I may decide to add more futures as my knowledge on the subject of trading grows.
